    {% call faq('Dear God, WHY?') %}
       <p>
            Because <em>data is delicious.</em>
        </p>
    {% endcall %}

    {% call faq('How did you do this?') %}
       <p>
            It's all done in Python.<br>
            A little script fetches all the data from the sites, results are parsed out, and a page is generated.
            The source is even <a href="https://github.com/interrostat/pokestats">on Github</a> for your perusal.
            I'd like to provide specific thanks to <a href="https://github.com/veekun/pokedex">veekun/pokedex</a>, for having such handy data files,
            and <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/">jinja2</a>, for making templating easy
        </p>
    {% endcall %}

    {% call faq('Can I help?') %}
       <p>
            Absolutely!<br>
            Most of the site was automatically generated, so not too much manual effort goes into making it.
        <p>
            But the tagging is <b>miserable</b> on some of these posts.
            If you can improve them, that'd be the best, both for me and for the users of the boards themselves.<br>
            If you'd rather help with code, the source is on <a href="https://github.com/interrostat">Github</a>, and the most complicated function - by far - is tag analysis.
            Got ideas? Bring them up there or <a href="https://twitter.com/interrostat">on twitter</a>! I'd be happy to take pull requests and discussions.

    {% call faq('Why did you choose these sites?') %}
       <p>
            They're the biggest sites I could easily query. All three expose an API that makes it simple to programatically fetch all
            the post information for a given tag, and from there I can eliminate duplicates (by cross-referencing the md5) and learn more tags.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.e621.net/">e621.net</a> is a general-furry pornography board. While it's not focused on Pok&eacute;mon material,
            it's sheer size and high tagging standards make it a key player in this game.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="http://rule34.paheal.net/">rule34.paheal.net</a> is probably the most famous of the rule34 sites. It's got huge volumes of content, but has sadly chosen
            to not tag sexuality information, so it doesn't help the charts.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.wildcritters.ws/">wildcritters.ws</a> and <a href="http://www.wildcritters.net/">wildcritters.net</a> supposedly specialize in cute and/or feral material. They've got a lot of Pok&eacute;mon postings, and high tagging standards, but some serious content biases. One third of it's pokemon-tagged posts involve Eevee evolutions!
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="http://rule34.xxx/">rule34.xxx</a> is the largest site on the booru.org network. It's got a <b>lot</b> of porn. Which is great for counting
            data, but the site's tagging is extremely poor. It's a miracle that people tag the individual Pok&eacute;mon species at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have any other suggestions, let me know! There's contact info at the end.

    {% call faq("Why don't you scrape DA / FA / Pixiv / etc?") %}
        <p>
            I want to!<br>
            But it just can't be done automatically. On most of the sites that function as "primary sources", people don't have much incentive to thoroughly and consistently
            tag images. And without tagging, there'd be no way to identify porn that belongs here.
        </p>
        <p>
            On top of that, the sites being used all identify image files the same way - by md5 hash. This makes it possible to tell when multiple sites are talking about the <b>same</b>
            image without having to download it first. Having to download everything would be incredibly expensive!

    {% call faq("What's with the sexuality charts?", id="sexuality") %}
        <p>
            The idea was just too great to pass up.<br>
            They're an attempt to categorize posts based on the tagging provided.<br>
            Each post is, if possible, categorized into one of the following buckets:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>G</b>: Bisexual/Group. These posts probably contain more than two characters, and that's as much as can be automatically determined.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>?</b>: Ambiguous/Intersex/Herm. There's nonbinary gender going on here.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>G</b>: Gay.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>M</b>: Male (solo).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>F</b>: Female (solo).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>L</b>: Lesbian. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>m</b>: Male (inferred). The image did not have sufficient tagging to put it in any of the above categories, but had tags (ie: "penis") implying it depicts a male.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>f</b>: Female (inferred). See above.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>s</b>: Straight (inferred). The image was not directly tagged into a category, but picked up signs of both male-inferred and female-inferred. Best guess is, it's straight. Alternatively, the image was directly tagged with 'male' and 'female', but nothing to say it's 'straight' or 'group' or 'ambiguous'.

    {% call faq("Can I access the data from this?") %}
        <p>
            Absolutely! The post-tag-combining data is available <a href="/combined_data.json">as a JSON file</a>.<br>
            Do let me know if you do anything interesting with it!

            The counts often don't quite match what shows up when you click the links. There's a couple reasons for this:
            <ul>
                <li>The searches on e621.net and wildcritters.ws use the -rating:safe filter, to exclude non-porn posts. On their site, the total counts seem to be
                both heavily cached and not always for exactly what the search query was. Trust the number of pages more than the sidebar.
                </li>
                <li>Additionally, the boards support parent/child post relationships for slight variations on an image, and I'm honestly not sure how that
                shows up in the data. They might not all show up, but I didn't actually check for that.
                </li>
            </ul>
            If you find another source of error, let me know! I'd be glad to fix it.
